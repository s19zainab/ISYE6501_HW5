# Question 8.2

Using crime data from http://www.statsci.org/data/general/uscrime.txt (file uscrime.txt, description at http://www.statsci.org/data/general/uscrime.html ), use regression (a useful R function is lm or glm) to predict the observed crime rate in a city with the following data:
  - M = 14.0
  - So = 0
  - Ed = 10.0
  - Po1 = 12.0
  - Po2 = 15.5
  - LF = 0.640
  - M.F = 94.0
  - Pop = 150
  - NW = 1.1
  - U1 = 0.120
  - U2 = 3.6
  - Wealth = 3200
  - Ineq = 20.1
  - Prob = 0.04
  - Time = 39.0
    
Show your model (factors used and their coefficients), the software output, and the quality of fit.
Note that because there are only 47 data points and 15 predictors, youâ€™ll probably notice some overfitting.
